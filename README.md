# lab-5-2x2latMaine
lab-5-2x2latMaine created by GitHub Classroom

In the first exercise, I created a sketch of my sprite drawMaxx();
Then I used what we learned in lab to make it bounce off of walls using if statements.
By doing myX *= -1, any time that the sprite touches the wall it will invert its speed and go in the other direction.

In the second exercise, we were insturcted to add keyPressed() to add functionality to our program.
I used multiple if() and else if() statements to use arrow key in a different way.
If you press any arrow, the sprites speed will increase in the obvious direction, up is up, down is down.
